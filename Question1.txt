Q. Explain the DOM and its role in Web development ?
    => The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of nodes. 
Each element (like tags, attributes, or text) is a node, and JavaScript can interact with this structure to dynamically manipulate the web page.

    ->Role in Web Development:
        *Dynamic Content: JavaScript can modify the content, style, or structure of a webpage in real-time without reloading the page.
        *Event Handling: Developers can attach event listeners (e.g., click, hover) to elements, making the page interactive.
        *Cross-Browser Compatibility: The DOM standard allows consistent manipulation of web content across browsers.
        *Responsive UI: Enables dynamic updates like animations, form validations, and real-time content updates, enhancing user experience.
