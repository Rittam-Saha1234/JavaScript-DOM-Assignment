Q.  Explain the concept of Event Bubbling in the DOM ?
    => Event bubbling in the DOM is a process where an event starts from the target element (where it was triggered) and then propagates upwards through its parent elements, all the way to the root of the document.

        -> How Event Bubbling Works:
                *When an event occurs (e.g., a click on a button), it first triggers on the target element.
                *Then, it "bubbles" up through the parent elements (like a <div>, <body>, etc.), triggering their event listeners if present.

        ->Example:
                *If you click on a button inside a <div>, the event first affects the button and then moves up to the <div>, then to the <body>, and so on.

        ->Usage:
                *Event bubbling is useful for techniques like event delegation, where you can handle events at a parent level instead of on individual child elements, improving efficiency.
