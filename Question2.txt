Q. Explain the concept of event delegation and provide a scenario where it is beneficial ?
    =>Event delegation is a JavaScript technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element, 
    allowing it to handle events triggered by its child elements. 
    This works due to event bubbling, where events propagate from the target element up to the parent elements in the DOM.

        ->Benefits of Event Delegation:
            *Improved Performance: Reduces the need for multiple event listeners.
            *Simplified Code: One listener can handle events for many child elements.
            *Handles Dynamic Content: Works with elements added to the DOM after the page loads.

        ->Scenario:
            In a dynamic list, instead of attaching a click event to every list item, attach a single event listener to the parent <ul> element. 
            This way, it handles clicks on all current and future <li> items efficiently.
